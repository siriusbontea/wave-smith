# Wavesmith

**Local-first AI music studio** — describe a song, get full tracks with vocals, build a library, pull stems. Inspired by Suno-style workflows, but everything runs on your machine: no accounts, no cloud API, no telemetry.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Verified platform** | macOS on Apple Silicon (M-series, 32 GB RAM tested) |
| **License** | GNU GPL v3.0 ([LICENSE](LICENSE)) |
| **Music engine** | [ACE-Step 1.5](https://github.com/ace-step/ACE-Step-1.5) (separate upstream project, MIT), pinned v0.1.8 |
| **Linux / NVIDIA** | [Documented only](docs/LINUX_CUDA.md) — not tested in this repo |

---

## What you get

- **Create** — natural-language prompts, 6 presets, Simple/Advanced tabs, 1–4 variations per forge
- **Library** — grid/list, procedural cover art, favorites, search, export/import (JSON metadata)
- **Playback** — one global player + waveform; seeking works (HTTP Range support)
- **Stems** — Demucs separation → vocals / drums / bass / other + ZIP download
- **Settings** — engine health, storage stats, theme, optional test generation

Optional **Generate Lyrics** uses a local [Ollama](https://ollama.com) model. If Ollama is not installed, that button hides and everything else still works.

---

## Requirements

### Hardware (recommended)

- **Apple Silicon Mac** (M1/M2/M3 class)
- **32 GB RAM** — engine weights (~10 GB on disk) plus runtime memory; 16 GB may work but is tight if you also run a large lyrics model concurrently
- **~25 GB free disk** after clone:
  - ~10 GB model weights (one-time download)
  - ~1.2 GB Python venv (engine)
  - ~1 GB Node dependencies
  - Generated audio grows under `./data/`

### Software (setup installs or checks these)

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) | Package manager on macOS |
| **Node.js** 22+ (26 verified) | Next.js app |
| **pnpm** | Node dependencies |
| **uv** | Python tooling for engine + Demucs |
| **ffmpeg** | MP3 encoding, media tooling |
| **Python 3.12** | Used by uv for Demucs install |
| **git** | Clone engine + this repo |

---

## What's in the repo vs what setup downloads

**Included in git:**

- Wavesmith app (Next.js 16, React 19, SQLite library)
- Scripts, tests, docs, `public/demo-clip.mp3` (mock/demo audio)
- `.env.example` — copy to `.env` on first setup

**Not in git** (created by `scripts/setup.sh` on your machine):

| Path | Size (approx.) | What it is |
|------|----------------|------------|
| `engine/ACE-Step-1.5/` | ~1.2 GB venv + ~10 GB weights | Pinned ACE-Step clone + models |
| `data/` | grows with use | SQLite DB + generated WAV/MP3/stems |
| `node_modules/` | ~hundreds of MB | App dependencies |
| `.env` | tiny | Your local config (never commit) |

---

## Quickstart (new users)

### 1. Clone

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url> wavesmith
cd wavesmith
```

### 2. One-time setup

```bash
chmod +x scripts/*.sh
./scripts/setup.sh
```

This is **idempotent** — safe to re-run. It will:

1. Check Homebrew, Node, pnpm, uv, ffmpeg
2. Copy `.env.example` → `.env` if missing
3. Clone ACE-Step 1.5 at tag **v0.1.8** into `engine/ACE-Step-1.5`
4. Run `uv sync` for engine Python deps
5. Download model weights (~**10 GB**, the long step on first run)
6. Install **Demucs** (stems) via `uv tool install`
7. `pnpm install` + database migrate

**Expect:** tens of minutes on first setup, mostly the model download.

### 3. Start Wavesmith

```bash
./scripts/dev.sh
```

This starts **two processes**:

| Process | URL | Role |
|---------|-----|------|
| ACE-Step engine | `http://127.0.0.1:8001` | Music generation (GPU/MLX) |
| Wavesmith app | **`http://127.0.0.1:3000`** | UI + API — **open this in your browser** |

> **Important:** The UI lives on port **3000**, not 8001. If you only start the engine, the browser will show API errors (404) when you click Forge.

First engine warm-up after boot takes about **45 seconds** with weights already on disk. The status banner at the top explains offline / starting / ready states.

### 4. Forge a song

1. Open **http://127.0.0.1:3000**
2. Enter a prompt (or click a preset)
3. Click **Forge** (default: 2 variations)
4. Watch the queue strip; when done, open **Library** to play

**Measured on M2 Max / 32 GB / macOS** (see `docs/ENGINE_NOTES.md`):

- ~22 s per 30 s song when forging 2 variations (batch)
- Stem separation (Demucs, CPU): a few minutes per song

---

## Optional: AI lyric writing (Ollama)

The built-in engine planner can write lyrics in Simple mode. For richer, editable lyrics in Advanced mode:

```bash
brew install ollama
ollama serve          # or launch the Ollama app
ollama pull dolphin3:8b   # ~5 GB; or use a model you already have
```

Set your model in `.env` if needed:

```bash
LYRICS_MODEL=dolphin3:8b
```

Wavesmith applies **no content filtering** to user-supplied lyrics — same as any local DAW.

---

## Demo mode (no engine, no GPU)

Tour the UI without installing ACE-Step or downloading weights:

```bash
# In .env:
MOCK_ENGINE=1

pnpm install   # if you skipped full setup
pnpm dev --hostname 127.0.0.1 --port 3000
```

Forge completes instantly using the bundled `public/demo-clip.mp3`.

---

## Production run

```bash
./scripts/start.sh   # pnpm build + engine + next start
```

Same URLs: app on **3000**, engine on **8001**.

---

## Troubleshooting

### `Request failed (404)` when clicking Forge

The **Next.js app is not running** (or you're on the wrong port). Run `./scripts/dev.sh` and use **http://127.0.0.1:3000**.

### Banner says "Engine offline"

Start both processes with `./scripts/dev.sh`, not the engine alone. Check engine logs prefixed with `[engine]`.

### Banner says "Engine starting…" for a long time

First run downloads and loads several GB of weights — normal once. Subsequent warm-ups are ~45 s.

### Model download stalls

See the direct-download fallback note in `docs/DECISIONS.md`. Re-run `./scripts/setup.sh` after fixing network/disk space.

### Stems button fails

Ensure Demucs installed: `demucs --help`. Re-run setup step or:

```bash
uv tool install --python 3.12 --with "torchaudio<2.9" demucs==4.0.1
```

### `pnpm test` / CI

Tests use the mock engine — no GPU or ACE-Step required:

```bash
MOCK_ENGINE=1 pnpm test
MOCK_ENGINE=1 pnpm test:e2e
```

### Real-engine smoke test

With engine running and weights loaded:

```bash
./scripts/smoke.sh
```

## Scripts reference

| Script | When to use |
|--------|-------------|
| `scripts/setup.sh` | First time + after pulling updates that change engine pin |
| `scripts/dev.sh` | Daily development (engine + hot-reload app) |
| `scripts/start.sh` | Production-style local run |
| `scripts/smoke.sh` | Verify full pipeline against real engine |

---

## Configuration

All variables are documented in [`.env.example`](.env.example). Common ones:

| Variable | Default | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------|
| `PORT` | `3000` | App URL port |
| `ENGINE_URL` | `http://127.0.0.1:8001` | ACE-Step REST API |
| `DATA_DIR` | `./data` | Library DB + audio |
| `MOCK_ENGINE` | `0` | Set `1` for demo mode |
| `LYRICS_MODEL` | `dolphin3:8b` | Ollama tag for Generate Lyrics |

---

## Architecture (short)

```
Browser  →  Wavesmith (Next.js @ :3000)  →  ACE-Step REST API (@ :8001)
                ├── SQLite (library, jobs)
                ├── ./data/audio
                ├── Demucs CLI (stems)
                └── Ollama (optional lyrics)
```

- One in-process job queue (concurrency 1 toward the engine)
- `EngineClient` + `MockEngineClient` seam — tests never need a GPU
- Audio served with HTTP **Range** support (seeking depends on it)

## Responsible use

Wavesmith wraps open-source models for **local, personal** music creation. You are responsible for how you use generated audio — respect copyright, likeness rights, and platform policies. [ACE-Step](https://github.com/ace-step/ACE-Step-1.5) includes its own responsible-use guidance upstream.

If you distribute modified versions of Wavesmith, the GPL v3 requires you to provide corresponding source and preserve license notices.

---

## Roadmap

Post-MVP ideas (not built here): Cover/Repaint/Extend, engine-native stems, LoRA UI, voice-to-prompt, SSE job updates, Tauri desktop wrap — see spec §14 in `wavesmith-claude-code-spec.md`.
